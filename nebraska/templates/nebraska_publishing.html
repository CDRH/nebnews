<h2>Publishing History of Newspapers in Nebraska</h2>

<p>The first newspaper published in Nebraska was a weekly military journal published by the garrison stationed at Ft. Atkinson, in present day Washington County. Described in the December 10, 1822 edition of the <em>Missouri  Intelligencer</em> as a "...manuscript, on a royal sheet, elegantly and  correctly executed in point of chirography; and in point of original matter not  exceeded by the first eastern publications." The newspaper, along with the  fort, did not survive very long. Fort Atkinson was terminated in 1827 and no  copies of its newspaper are known to exist today. </p>

<p>Thirty years later, with the opening of Nebraska Territory in 1854, newspapers helped to boost and to develop the new region. The first of these,  the <em>Nebraska Palladium</em>, declared on July 15th, "This paper will be  strenuously devoted to the support of the great interests involved in the early  settlement of this rich, beautiful, and desirable county. It will be an earnest  advocate of the immediate establishment of those industrial, social, political,  and religious institutions which can avail a permanence to society." </p>

<p>Although it was titled the <em>Nebraska Palladium</em>, there was not a press  in the Territory to print the newspaper. Therefore, the first issues were  printed on a press in St. Mary, Iowa, a settlement across the Missouri River  opposite Bellevue. </p>

<p>A critic of Nebraska's territorial newspapers characterized them as being  "rough and pugnacious, but withal manly and efficient." They drew  their subscribers mainly from the east and were organs of town companies with a  vested interest in seeing Nebraska settled. These early newspapers bear little  resemblance to the newspapers of today. Headlines were uncommon, photographs  were not a standard feature, and wire news was virtually non-existent. A  typical issue consisted of four pages, the first of which was devoted to poetry  and articles taken from eastern papers. The third and fourth pages carried  mostly advertising. Local news and editorial comment, "puff practice  shamelessly" according to one historian, appeared on page two. Produced in  an era and a place where few printed materials were available, these newspapers  provided a sense of community and a cultural influence for the newly arrived  inhabitants of Nebraska Territory.</p>

<p>The mortality rate of the early newspapers was high as competition among  editors was intense. The above-mentioned <em>Nebraska Palladium</em> lasted less  than a year, suspending operations in April 1855. Some publications, however,  have continued a long and healthy existence until today, guided in their  formative years by Nebraska's earliest political leaders. Robert Furnas,  founder of Brownville's first newspaper, the <em>Nebraska Advertiser</em>,  championed the horticultural and agricultural possibilities of Nebraska soil,  as well as his own Republican party views. Although the <em>Advertiser</em> doesn't exist today, the <em>Nebraska Farmer</em>, an agricultural journal which  still appears monthly, was founded by Furnas in 1859. J. Sterling Morton, the  promoter of Arbor Day, edited the <em>Nebraska City News</em> to reflect his  political views in support of the Democratic party. It, along with the <em>Falls  City Journal</em>, are the only two newspapers among the two hundred newspapers  currently being published in the state with roots in the territorial period. </p>

<p>Having a political ax to grind was commonplace for Furnas, Morton, and the  majority of Nebraska's newspaper editors. William Jennings Bryan, first an  editor for the <em>Omaha World-Herald</em>, split with that newspaper to trumpet  the Populist cause in his own newspaper, <em>The Commoner</em>. Willa Cather's  first published writings appeared in a newspaper, the <em>Nebraska State Journal</em>, while she attended the University of Nebraska. Her views of late 19th century  popular culture were reflected in her reviews as a drama critic.</p>

<p>Special interests of all kinds were reflected in newspapers seeking  subscribers who shared the views and/or the background of the publisher.  Temperance/prohibition publications, ethnic newspapers, the foreign language  press, and women's rights newspapers thrived because an audience welcomed them.</p>

<p>The growth of the newspaper industry paralleled the development of the state. As settlement pushed westward, most communities could boast of having at least one newspaper. Bigger towns often had two, one espousing Democratic  views, the other, Republican. (In the 1890s and early 1900s, some towns had  room for a third newspaper that supported the Populist Party.) By 1920, 623 newspapers were being published in Nebraska. This was the peak of newspaper publishing in the state, as the industry began a gradual decrease in the number of publications.</p>

<p>Economic hardships in the 1920s and 1930s caused some newspapers to close shop. Other factors contributing to the disappearance of small town newspapers included  the decline of the rural population; the appearance of other forms of  communication, particularly radio and television; and the rise of metropolitan  newspapers.</p>

<p>Today there are about 200 newspapers covering Nebraska news. They continue to provide cohesiveness and to reflect the political, economic, and social thinking of their towns and time. <br>

</p><p>As one historian has summarized: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are glad to believe that every paper in Nebraska has a place in its history, and that no other agency — not even the great corporations with all their wealth and farseeing enterprise, not even the governing men and statesmen who have labored to give Nebraska position, influence, and fame — has wielded a greater influence for the  prosperity and importance of the State, than the cloud of news print which  every week settles down among its busy population." </p>

<h2>Early Nebraska Journalists</h2>

<h4>William Jennings Bryan</h4>

<p>Three-time Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan was born in Illinois in 1860 and moved to Nebraska in 1887 where he was elected to Congress in 1890. Bryan served from 1894 to 1896 as editor of the <i>Omaha World-Herald</i>, using this position to further his political agenda. In 1896, backed by the Populist agrarian movement, Bryan ran for president of the United States, but was defeated by the Republican nominee William McKinley. Bryan was nominated for president again in 1900 but was defeated. After this defeat, Bryan in 1901 founded <i>The Commoner</i> in Lincoln to voice his political views. Bryan again ran unsuccessfully for president in 1908. In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson named Bryan as secretary of state. He continued to publish <i>The Commoner</i> until 1923.</p>

Furnas settled in Brownville and began publishing the <i>Nebraska Advertiser</i> and the <i>Nebraska Farmer</i>. The <i>Nebraska Farmer</i> was Nebraska's first agricultural periodical and is still published today. Furnas was elected to the territorial legislature where he wrote legislation establishing the Nebraska Board of Agriculture. He was the first president of the agriculture board, the first president of the Nebraska State Historical Society, a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska and one of the founders of Arbor Day.

In 1871, Rosewater founded the <i>Omaha Bee</i>, which under his guidance grew into the leading Republican newspaper in the Midwest. The <i>Bee</i> supported progressive ideas such as creation of a school board for the Omaha Public Schools and direct election of senators, but it opposed women's suffrage. In 1919, the <i>Bee</i> published a series of sensational stories of racial incidents in Omaha. Rosewater served on the Republican National Committee and was organizer for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898. Rosewater ran twice for the U.S. Senate, both times unsuccessfully.</p>
