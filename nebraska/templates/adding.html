    <h2>Adding Newspapers</h2>
    <p>If you have funding and would like to see your newspapers added to
Nebraska Newspapers, please see the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/">technical guidelines</a>
provided on the  <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/">Chronicling America</a> website. All newspapers included here
must follow the guidelines.</p>

    <p>Important considerations include the historical significance and the
language(s) used in the newspaper â€“ currently only English, French,
German, Italian, and Spanish languages are allowed. Other considerations
include the availability, the technical quality, and the completeness of
the microfilm. All newspapers must have a catalog record included in the
<a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/titles/">US Newspaper Directory</a>.</p>

    <p>Before digitizing your newspapers for inclusion on the Nebraska Newspapers
website, please consult with Katherine Walter (kwalter1 [at] unl.edu).</p>
