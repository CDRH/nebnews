  <p>From 2007 to the present, the National Digital Newspaper Program: Nebraska has been digitizing historically significant Nebraska newspapers for inclusion on this website and in <em><a href="http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/">Chronicling America</a></em>, a freely available full-text database at the Library of Congress. The <a href="http://www.neh.gov/projects/ndnp.html">National Digital Newspaper Program</a> (NDNP) is a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Library of Congress, and state projects to provide enhanced access to United States newspapers published between 1836 and 1922.</p>

  <p>The University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln Libraries, the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, the College of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication, and the Nebraska State Historical Society received NEH funding in 2007 to digitize 100,000 pages of newspapers from 1880-1910. Another award was received in 2009 for an additional 100,000 pages from 1860-1922.</p>

  <p>Through private and state funding, the Nebraska project will be expanded to include newspapers outside the scope of the NDNP project. The first non-NDNP newspaper to be included is the <em>Daily Nebraskan</em>, UNL's student newspaper. Other papers will be digitized and placed online as funding becomes available.</p>

  <p>This digitization effort is an outgrowth of the Nebraska Newspaper Project, which was originally funded by the NEH from 1992-2000 and was an affiliate of the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/preserv/usnppr.html">U.S. Newspaper Program</a>.</p>
